1. **Collecting Data**: Developing tools and workflows to acquire data from multiple sources and designing scalable data architectures.
2. **Processing Data**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for use, implementing distributed systems, and ensuring data quality and security.
3. **Storing Data**: Architecting data stores and ensuring scalability, privacy, and compliance.
4. **Making Data Available**: Using APIs, services, and dashboards to provide secure, rights-based access to data.

## Differences Between Databases, Data Warehouses, and Data Lakes

### Databases
- **Purpose**: Designed for transactional processing (OLTP) and storing structured data.
- **Data Structure**: Stores data in tables with rows and columns, enforcing a schema.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for applications requiring real-time data access and updates, such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems.

### Data Warehouses
- **Purpose**: Designed for analytical processing (OLAP) and storing historical data for reporting and analysis.
- **Data Structure**: Stores structured data, often aggregated and optimized for query performance.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for business intelligence (BI) and analytics, where data is queried to generate reports and insights.

### Data Lakes
- **Purpose**: Designed to store vast amounts of raw data in its native format, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
- **Data Structure**: Stores data as-is without enforcing a schema, allowing for flexibility in data ingestion.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for big data analytics, machine learning, and data exploration, where data scientists and analysts need access to raw data for various analyses.

## Responsibilities and Skillsets of a Data Engineer

### Responsibilities
- **Provide Analytics-Ready Data**: Ensure data is accurate, reliable, compliant, and accessible.
