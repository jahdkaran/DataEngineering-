## Data Ecosystem

### Overview
A data engineerâ€™s ecosystem includes the infrastructure, tools, frameworks, and processes for:
- Extracting data from disparate sources.
- Architecting and managing data pipelines for transformation, integration, and storage.
- Architecting and managing data repositories.
- Automating and optimizing workflows and data flow between systems.
- Developing applications needed through the data engineering workflow.

### Types of Data
- **Structured Data**: Organized into rows and columns (e.g., databases, spreadsheets).
- **Semi-Structured Data**: Mix of structured and unstructured data (e.g., emails).
- **Unstructured Data**: Complex, qualitative information (e.g., photos, videos, text files).

### Data Repositories
- **Transactional Systems (OLTP)**: Store high-volume operational data (e.g., banking transactions).
- **Analytical Systems (OLAP)**: Optimized for complex data analytics (e.g., data warehouses, data lakes).

### Data Integration
- Tools combine data from disparate sources into a unified view for users to query and manipulate.

### Data Pipelines
- Cover the journey of data from source to destination using processes like ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) or ELT (Extract-Load-Transform).

### Languages
- **Query Languages**: SQL for querying and manipulating data.
- **Programming Languages**: Python for developing data applications.
- **Shell and Scripting Languages**: For repetitive operational tasks.

### BI and Reporting Tools
- Collect and present data in visual formats (e.g., interactive dashboards) without requiring programming knowledge.

### Automation
- Automated tools, frameworks, and processes for all stages of the data analytics process.

## Types of Data

### Structured Data
- **Definition**: Well-defined structure, stored in schemas like databases, represented in rows and columns.
- **Sources**: SQL databases, OLTP systems, spreadsheets, online forms, sensors (GPS, RFID), network and web server logs.
- **Storage**: Relational or SQL databases.
- **Analysis**: Easily examined with standard data analysis methods and tools.

### Semi-Structured Data
- **Definition**: Some organizational properties, lacks a fixed schema, contains tags and elements for hierarchy.
- **Sources**: Emails, XML, binary executables, TCP/IP packets, zipped files, data integration from different sources.
- **Storage**: XML, JSON.
- **Analysis**: Requires specialized tools for hierarchical data.

### Unstructured Data
- **Definition**: No identifiable structure, cannot be organized in relational databases.
- **Sources**: Web pages, social media feeds, images, video and audio files, documents, PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, media logs, surveys.
- **Storage**: Files, documents, NoSQL databases.
- **Analysis**: Requires specialized tools for examining heterogeneous data.
