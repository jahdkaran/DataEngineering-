## Data Ecosystem

### Overview
A data engineerâ€™s ecosystem includes the infrastructure, tools, frameworks, and processes for:
- Extracting data from disparate sources.
- Architecting and managing data pipelines for transformation, integration, and storage.
- Architecting and managing data repositories.
- Automating and optimizing workflows and data flow between systems.
- Developing applications needed through the data engineering workflow.

### Types of Data
- **Structured Data**: Organized into rows and columns (e.g., databases, spreadsheets).
- **Semi-Structured Data**: Mix of structured and unstructured data (e.g., emails).
- **Unstructured Data**: Complex, qualitative information (e.g., photos, videos, text files).

### Data Repositories
- **Transactional Systems (OLTP)**: Store high-volume operational data (e.g., banking transactions).
- **Analytical Systems (OLAP)**: Optimized for complex data analytics (e.g., data warehouses, data lakes).

### Data Integration
- Tools combine data from disparate sources into a unified view for users to query and manipulate.

### Data Pipelines
- Cover the journey of data from source to destination using processes like ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) or ELT (Extract-Load-Transform).

### Languages
- **Query Languages**: SQL for querying and manipulating data.
- **Programming Languages**: Python for developing data applications.
- **Shell and Scripting Languages**: For repetitive operational tasks.

### BI and Reporting Tools
- Collect and present data in visual formats (e.g., interactive dashboards) without requiring programming knowledge.

### Automation
- Automated tools, frameworks, and processes for all stages of the data analytics process.

## Types of Data

### Structured Data
- **Definition**: Well-defined structure, stored in schemas like databases, represented in rows and columns.
- **Sources**: SQL databases, OLTP systems, spreadsheets, online forms, sensors (GPS, RFID), network and web server logs.
- **Storage**: Relational or SQL databases.
- **Analysis**: Easily examined with standard data analysis methods and tools.

### Semi-Structured Data
- **Definition**: Some organizational properties, lacks a fixed schema, contains tags and elements for hierarchy.
- **Sources**: Emails, XML, binary executables, TCP/IP packets, zipped files, data integration from different sources.
- **Storage**: XML, JSON.
- **Analysis**: Requires specialized tools for hierarchical data.

### Unstructured Data
- **Definition**: No identifiable structure, cannot be organized in relational databases.
- **Sources**: Web pages, social media feeds, images, video and audio files, documents, PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, media logs, surveys.
- **Storage**: Files, documents, NoSQL databases.
- **Analysis**: Requires specialized tools for examining heterogeneous data.

## Data Sources

### Internal Sources
- **Relational Databases**: SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, IBM DB2.
- **Applications**: Support business activities, customer transactions, HR activities.

### External Sources
- **Public and Private Datasets**: Government data, Point-of-Sale data, Financial data, Weather data.
- **Formats**: Flat files (CSV), spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets), XML documents.

### APIs and Web Services
- **Definition**: Interfaces for obtaining data from various sources.
- **Examples**: Twitter and Facebook APIs for sentiment analysis, Stock Market APIs, Data Lookup and Validation APIs.

### Web Scraping
- **Definition**: Extracting data from web pages.
- **Tools**: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Pandas, Selenium.
- **Uses**: Price comparisons, sales leads, forum data extraction, machine learning datasets.

### Data Streams
- **Sources**: Instruments, IoT devices, GPS data, social media posts.
- **Applications**: Apache Kafka, Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Storm.
- **Uses**: Financial trading, demand prediction, threat detection, sentiment analysis, industrial monitoring, web performance, flight rebooking.

### RSS Feeds
- **Definition**: Capturing updated data from forums and news sites.
- **Tools**: Feed readers for streaming updates to user devices.

## Overview of Data Repositories

A data repository is a general term for data that has been collected, organized, and isolated for business operations or analysis. It can range from small to large database infrastructures with one or more databases. In this video, we will provide an overview of different types of repositories such as databases, data warehouses, and big data stores.

### Databases
- **Definition**: A collection of data designed for input, storage, search, retrieval, and modification.
- **DBMS**: Database Management System, a set of programs that creates and maintains the database.
- **Types**:
  - **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**: Organize data in a tabular format with rows and columns, optimized for data operations and querying. Uses SQL.
  - **Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)**: Schema-less, built for speed, flexibility, and scale. Used for processing big data.

### Data Warehouses
- **Definition**: Central repositories that merge information from disparate sources and consolidate it through the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for analytics and business intelligence.
- **Related Concepts**: Data Marts and Data Lakes, which can be relational or non-relational.

### Big Data Stores
- **Definition**: Distributed computational and storage infrastructure to store, scale, and process very large data sets.

## NoSQL Databases

### Overview
NoSQL stands for "not only SQL" and refers to non-relational database designs that provide flexible schemas for data storage and retrieval. They are popular for their scalability, performance, and ease of use, especially in the era of cloud computing, big data, and high-volume web and mobile applications.

### Types of NoSQL Databases
1. **Key-Value Store**:
   - **Definition**: Data stored as key-value pairs.
   - **Uses**: User session data, real-time recommendations, in-memory data caching.
   - **Examples**: Redis, Memcached, DynamoDB.

2. **Document-Based**:
   - **Definition**: Each record and its data stored within a single document.
   - **Uses**: eCommerce platforms, medical records, CRM platforms, analytics.
   - **Examples**: MongoDB, DocumentDB, CouchDB, Cloudant.

3. **Column-Based**:
   - **Definition**: Data stored in cells grouped as columns.
   - **Uses**: Heavy write requests, time-series data, weather data, IoT data.
   - **Examples**: Cassandra, HBase.

4. **Graph-Based**:
   - **Definition**: Data represented and stored using a graphical model.
   - **Uses**: Social networks, real-time recommendations, network diagrams, fraud detection.
   - **Examples**: Neo4J, CosmosDB.

### Advantages of NoSQL
- **Handling Large Volumes**: Manages structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
- **Distributed Systems**: Scales across multiple data centers, leveraging cloud infrastructure.
- **Cost-Effective**: Scale-out architecture with additional capacity and performance.
- **Agility and Flexibility**: Simpler design, better control over availability, improved scalability.

### Key Differences Between RDBMS and NoSQL
- **Schema**: RDBMS has rigid schemas; NoSQL is schema-agnostic.
- **Cost**: RDBMS is expensive; NoSQL is designed for low-cost hardware.
- **ACID Compliance**: RDBMS supports ACID transactions; most NoSQL databases do not.
- **Maturity**: RDBMS is a mature technology; NoSQL is relatively newer but increasingly used for critical applications.
