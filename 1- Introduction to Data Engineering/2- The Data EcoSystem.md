## Overview of Data Repositories

A data repository is a general term for data that has been collected, organized, and isolated for business operations or analysis. It can range from small to large database infrastructures with one or more databases. In this video, we will provide an overview of different types of repositories such as databases, data warehouses, and big data stores.

### Databases
- **Definition**: A collection of data designed for input, storage, search, retrieval, and modification.
- **DBMS**: Database Management System, a set of programs that creates and maintains the database.
- **Types**:
  - **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**: Organize data in a tabular format with rows and columns, optimized for data operations and querying. Uses SQL.
  - **Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)**: Schema-less, built for speed, flexibility, and scale. Used for processing big data.

### Data Warehouses
- **Definition**: Central repositories that merge information from disparate sources and consolidate it through the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for analytics and business intelligence.
- **Related Concepts**: Data Marts and Data Lakes, which can be relational or non-relational.

### Big Data Stores
- **Definition**: Distributed computational and storage infrastructure to store, scale, and process very large data sets.

## NoSQL Databases

### Overview
NoSQL stands for "not only SQL" and refers to non-relational database designs that provide flexible schemas for data storage and retrieval. They are popular for their scalability, performance, and ease of use, especially in the era of cloud computing, big data, and high-volume web and mobile applications.

### Types of NoSQL Databases
1. **Key-Value Store**:
   - **Definition**: Data stored as key-value pairs.
   - **Uses**: User session data, real-time recommendations, in-memory data caching.
   - **Examples**: Redis, Memcached, DynamoDB.

2. **Document-Based**:
   - **Definition**: Each record and its data stored within a single document.
   - **Uses**: eCommerce platforms, medical records, CRM platforms, analytics.
   - **Examples**: MongoDB, DocumentDB, CouchDB, Cloudant.

3. **Column-Based**:
   - **Definition**: Data stored in cells grouped as columns.
   - **Uses**: Heavy write requests, time-series data, weather data, IoT data.
   - **Examples**: Cassandra, HBase.

4. **Graph-Based**:
   - **Definition**: Data represented and stored using a graphical model.
   - **Uses**: Social networks, real-time recommendations, network diagrams, fraud detection.
   - **Examples**: Neo4J, CosmosDB.

### Advantages of NoSQL
- **Handling Large Volumes**: Manages structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
- **Distributed Systems**: Scales across multiple data centers, leveraging cloud infrastructure.
- **Cost-Effective**: Scale-out architecture with additional capacity and performance.
- **Agility and Flexibility**: Simpler design, better control over availability, improved scalability.

### Key Differences Between RDBMS and NoSQL
- **Schema**: RDBMS has rigid schemas; NoSQL is schema-agnostic.
- **Cost**: RDBMS is expensive; NoSQL is designed for low-cost hardware.
- **ACID Compliance**: RDBMS supports ACID transactions; most NoSQL databases do not.
- **Maturity**: RDBMS is a mature technology; NoSQL is relatively newer but increasingly used for critical applications.

## Data Movement Approaches

### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- **Definition**: Automated process to convert raw data into analysis-ready data.
- **Steps**:
  - **Extract**: Collect data from source locations.
    - **Batch Processing**: Move data in large chunks at scheduled intervals (e.g., Stitch, Blendo).
    - **Stream Processing**: Pull data in real-time and transform in transit (e.g., Apache Samza, Apache Storm, Apache Kafka).
  - **Transform**: Convert raw data into usable data.
    - Examples: Consistent date formats, removing duplicates, filtering unnecessary data, enriching data, establishing key relationships, applying business rules.
  - **Load**: Transport processed data to a destination system.
    - Types: Initial loading, incremental loading, full refresh.
    - Load verification: Check for missing/null values, server performance, monitor load failures.
- **Tools**: IBM Infosphere Information Server, AWS Glue, Improvado, Skyvia, HEVO, Informatica PowerCenter.

### ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)
- **Definition**: Extracted data is first loaded into the target system, then transformed.
- **Destination**: Typically a data lake, but can also be a data warehouse.
- **Advantages**:
  - Shortens cycle between extraction and delivery.
  - Allows ingestion of large volumes of raw data immediately.
  - Greater flexibility for exploratory data analytics.
  - Transforms only required data for specific analysis.
  - More suited for Big Data.

### Data Pipelines
- **Definition**: Broader term encompassing the entire journey of moving data from one system to another.
- **Types**:
  - **Batch Processing**: Long-running batch queries.
  - **Streaming Data**: Continuous flow of data processing/transformation.
  - **Combination**: Mix of batch and streaming data.
- **Destination**: Typically a data lake, but can also be other applications or visualization tools.
- **Tools**: Apache Beam, AirFlow, DataFlow.

In this video, we learned about different data movement approachesâ€”ETL, ELT, and Data Pipelines, and how they facilitate the journey of data from source to destination systems.
